"item banc create items" intends to make an easy interface for businesses to tokenize their inventories
specifically, only one nft per sku (stock keeping unit).
the goal of this is to create information currency: What is available, Where, at What Price.
there is no immediate intention to trade or to transact these NFTs. 
with information currency related to business inventories there will be a new market
our goal is to make this market open and identifiable to any.
our goal is to make products available for sale discoverable without the interference of ads, or rankings
or other centralized monikers.
